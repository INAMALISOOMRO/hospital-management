# MySQL Server Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Change DB_HOST to the IP address of the computer running MySQL
DB_HOST=192.168.1.12
DB_PORT=3306

# FIXED: Changed from hospital-user to hospital_user (underscore not hyphen)
DB_USER=hospital_user
DB_PASSWORD=@Inamalisoomro90mysql
DB_NAME=hospital_management

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
# ============================================
# 
# If sync is not working, check these:
#
# 1. VERIFY MYSQL IS RUNNING ON SERVER PC:
#    - Open MySQL Workbench or command line on 192.168.1.12
#    - Run: SELECT 1; 
#    - If this fails, MySQL service is not running
#
# 2. CHECK NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:
#    From client PC, open Command Prompt and run:
#    - ping 192.168.1.12
#    If this fails, computers are not on same network
#
# 3. CHECK FIREWALL ON SERVER PC (192.168.1.12):
#    - Windows Firewall must allow MySQL port 3306
#    - Add inbound rule for port 3306
#
# 4. VERIFY MYSQL ALLOWS REMOTE CONNECTIONS:
#    On server PC, check MySQL config file (my.ini or my.cnf):
#    - bind-address should be 0.0.0.0 (not 127.0.0.1)
#    - Restart MySQL after changing
#
# 5. VERIFY USER HAS REMOTE ACCESS:
#    On server PC, run in MySQL:
#    - SHOW GRANTS FOR 'hospital_user'@'%';
#    Should show access from any host (%)
#
# 6. TEST FROM COMMAND LINE:
#    From client PC, open Command Prompt:
#    mysql -h 192.168.1.12 -u hospital_user -p hospital_management
#    (Enter password when prompted)
#    If this works, connection is possible
#
# 7. WIFI vs ETHERNET:
#    - WiFi works fine for local network
#    - Ensure both PCs are on SAME WiFi network
#    - Some routers have "Client Isolation" - must be DISABLED
